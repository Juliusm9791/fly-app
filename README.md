## Description

Everyday there is an executive or celebrity booking private air travel through a network of operators and brokers. These individuals pay enormous rates for the priviledge of avoiding commercial. However, approximately 30% of these bookings result in what is known as an "empty leg", where the jet travels to the client EMPTY! Empty legs are currently marketed by these same brokers, as discounted. The "discount" is often not far from retail cost, and flights still remain empty in-route to market-rate clients.

Fly App seeks to solve this problem by auctioning off empty legs, opening up the industry to a middle-class market that never could have afforded such a travel option. Users can view active auctions, login to place a bid, and as timer expires, can proceed to secure checkout. A simple solution that seeks to eliminate the private jet brokeage industry, making luxury travel affordable to a new market sect, and solves the drastic waste that ensues due to empty leg flights traveling throughout our airspace.
